# Runic Cleansing
Made by Neil and Anobpob for Kenney Jam 2020, a 2 day game jam where all art assets must be made by Kenney.  The jam's theme was Cursed. https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2020

The game is a simple top-down action game where you explore a cursed house, avoid zombies and other monsters, and place runes in the indicated locations to remove the curse from the house.
